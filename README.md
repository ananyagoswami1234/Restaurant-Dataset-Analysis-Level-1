🚀 Restaurant Dataset Analysis: Unveiling Geographical and Culinary Insights 🌍🍽️

I’m excited to share my in-depth analysis of a restaurant dataset, which explores the distribution of restaurants, culinary trends, and rating patterns. Here’s what I’ve uncovered:

Task 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- Dataset Overview: 📊 I reviewed the dataset’s size and structure to understand its complexity, including an initial preview to spot any inconsistencies.
- Handling Missing Values: 🛠️ Addressed missing values in the 'Cuisines' column by filling them with 'Unknown' to keep the dataset complete.
- Data Type Conversion: 🔄 Ensured data types were correctly set for accurate analysis and visualization.
- Target Variable Analysis: 📈 Analyzed the 'Aggregate rating' distribution with histograms and KDE curves to reveal rating trends and class distribution.

Task 2. Descriptive Analysis:
- Statistical Measures: 📉 Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation to understand the central tendency and variability of numerical data.
- Categorical Variables: 🌐 Explored 'Country Code', 'City', and 'Cuisines' distributions to uncover geographical restaurant spreads and popular culinary trends.

Task 3. Geospatial Analysis:
- Restaurant Locations Map: 🗺️ Created interactive maps with Folium to visualize restaurant locations, adding heatmaps and markers to highlight high-density areas.
- Distribution Analysis: 🌆 Analyzed restaurant distribution across cities and countries to identify regions with the most significant numbers of restaurants.
- Correlation Analysis: 🔍 Examined relationships between restaurant ratings and geographical coordinates using scatter plots and correlation matrices. Ratings distribution was also visualized through boxplots across top cities and countries.

Tools and Techniques Used:
- Data Exploration: 🛠️ Pandas for data manipulation and handling missing values.
- Data Visualization: 📊 Matplotlib and Seaborn for histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Geospatial Visualization: 🌍 Folium’s HeatMap and MarkerCluster plugins for interactive maps.

Conclusion:
This analysis provides valuable insights into restaurant distribution, culinary preferences, and rating patterns. 
By examining these aspects, I’ve highlighted significant trends that offer actionable insights for stakeholders in the restaurant industry.
